# Art Portfolio
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

NOTE: This app requires its back-end partner repository, **art-portfolio-backend** (https://github.com/dennis0802/artPortfolio-backend), to function properly. The interactions with PostgreSQL and retrieving data from Express come from this repository.

Both must be running at the same time for the artPortfolio project to run properly. Uses React-Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Running the Build
With the build folder (Use command: `npm run build`), run command: `npx serve -s build -l port_num_here`
